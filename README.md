# wimer - a simple countdown timer for Windows

It shows on the right border of the current screen and updates as time elapses.

The default period is 5 minutes.
Use CTRL + MOUSE_WHEEL_UP to add a minute, CTRL + MOUSE_WHEEL_DOWN to reduce by a minute.
Use CTRL + LEFT_DOUBLE_CLICK to reset.

Hit ESCAPE to exit.

I intend to use this in (online) meetings when sharing my desktop. Folks will
see their speaking time pass and - hopefully - finish soon enough.
